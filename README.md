Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering Instructions: Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions: Define Software Engineering: 

Development and Creation of software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 

Software engineering differs from tradional programming in the sense that tradional programmers usually focus on writing code and software itself while software engineering focuses on constructing the structure of the software using complex computer science and engineering. The Software Development Life Cycle is used to control software organisation and creation and its includes the following steps: planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Planning - This is the first stage where the developer writes down the objectives of the projects and ideas for the project. // 
Design - This is the phase where the developers produce flowcharts of the program to be written and also pseudocode for the program to be written. 
Development - This is where actual code is written based on the designed flowcharts and pseudocode using the appropriate coding language.
Testing - The written program is tested to make sure it works properly with no bugs or faults.
Deployment - This is where the software is made available for use by uploading the program into the market. 
Maintenance - After the program is uploaded onto the market, the software needs to be kept updated so that its up-to-date and have no bugs since no software can be perfectly developed.
Agile Models are when the software is updated and developed using continuous customer feedback and its an iterative model where this customer feedback is looped over and over again to produce a high quality program which meets the customers needs.
Waterfall Models are when the developers finishes each phase of the development perfectly and its more of a sequential model where it flows like a waterfall when each phase leads to the next phase after its done and you usually dont move back up the waterfall.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering: 




What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Submission Guidelines: Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point. Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
